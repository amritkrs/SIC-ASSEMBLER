# SIC-ASSEMBLER
Implementation of SIC assembler in python 
This program was implemented as part of assignment in System Programming course.

The program actually took a lot of code and ideas from travcunn as I started learning python that time.
So many thanks to travconn. The link to his code is "https://github.com/travcunn/sic_assembler"

I have only modified it a little for it to work for SIC only.
